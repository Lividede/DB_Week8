Library Management System (MySQL-Based)

## 📝 Description

This project is a relational database system for managing a library's book inventory, member records, borrowing transactions, and staff data. It allows efficient management of borrowing activities and tracks book availability.

## 🚀 How to Run/Setup

1. Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system.
2. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or terminal).
3. Execute the SQL script file (`library_db.sql`) to create and initialize the database.
4. You can then run SQL queries to interact with the system (insert members, add books, manage borrowings, etc).

## 🧩 Features

* Members and Staff tables for user management.
* Book inventory with author and category details.
* Borrowing records to track lending and returns.
* Support for many-to-many relationships between books and categories.
